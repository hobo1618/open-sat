## The test is getting trickier.
There are and will always be questions that I hate to teach but cannot avoid.
On the old, paper-based SAT there were two such questions in the *conventions of English* section,
both on the same topic, both of which were borderline impossible for many students to comprehend.
For years, literally *f##king* years, however, I did what I had to do.
I rolled the ball up the hill, lesson after lesson, only for everthing I had taught to come rolling back down the hill as soon as my student sign off and went back to doing whatever it is that you kids do these days.

Then the test changed and I was horrified to find that this question format is *way* more common that it used to be.
So now I have to teach this stupid concept even more than before. 
This skill, in fact, has become a crucial one to master if you want to get an 800 in the language, because it is pretty much sure to come up, and if you don't know what to look for, well, you're pretty much fucked because you're not going to figure it out on the spot.  

### Opening problem
So this is it, the problem that started it all back in 2016, but adapted, slightly, to match the new format. Are ready to hate your life? I am sorry. I really am.

>     <li>job, however. No</li>
>     <li>job—however, no</li>

> </ol>

Here goes.

### 1. How do these punctuation marks work?

| mark | rule | example | note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| comma , | *cannot* lie between two full sentences | I like cats, they are fluffy | This mistake is called a *run-on* sentence, or otherwise a *comma-splice* |
| period, or full stop | *must* lie between two full sentences | *I like cats. They are fluffy.* | This is obviously correct. It's just two *normal* sentences |
| dash — | *must* have a full sentence on its left-hand side* | *I like cats. They are fluffy.* | This is obviously correct. It's just two *normal* sentences |

<figcaption>*This is lie, but close enough to the truth. Check [The Chicago Manual of Style](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/home.html) if you really want the truth and no friends. I know. I've been there.</figcaption>

<br/>

Taking the sentences one by one, then. 

### Finding the dividing point
But how / where are we supposed to divide the sentence, exactly?
Before or after the word *however*?
And does the word *however* change anything? 

Let's divide the option *A* at the comma before *however*:

| left hand side | punctuation mark | right-hand side |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conceptualizing a game is only the beginning of a video game designer’s job | (comma ,) | however, no matter how good a concept is, it will never be translated into a video game unless it is communicated effectively to all the other members of the video game development team. |

So what's wrong with this?

Yup, it's a run-on sentence. The left and right hand sides are both complete sentences, so together they form a run-on sentence.

But what about the *however*? 
Does it change anything?
Can't we join two sentences with a *however*?

No. No, we can't. 
I might sound right to you, but the word *however* isn't a *conjuction*.
It's an adverb. More speifically, it's a *conjunctive adverb*.
Which means that it can't join two sentences together without help.


Adverbs in general are **always optional**.
If you see one of these **conjunctive adverbs**, you can **take it out of the sentence completely** and the sentence will be structurally correct if it was structurally correct with the adverb, and it will wrong if it wrong with the adverb.

This means that this sentence is incorrect:

> 
> *I am hungry, however, I won't eat anything.*
> 

<details>
    <summary>
        Can you think of why the above sentence is wrong? How might you fix them based on the rules we've covered so far?

    </summary>
        All four are [*run-on sentences*](#run-on-sentences) because the *conjunctive adverbs* don't connect sentences syntatically.
        > 
        > ❌*I am hungry, however, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        > ✅*I am hungry; however, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        > ✅*I am hungry. However, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        > ✅*I am hungry<span>&mdash;</span>however, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        These are just a few of the possible ways we could fix this run-on sentence without changing the underlying structure too much.
</details>



For example, we could use a *semicolon* to join the two sentences together, or we could use a *dash*. Or we could just use a *period*.

### Conjunctive Adverbs vs Conjunctions

You might be more familiar with the term *transition word*.

Conjunctive adverbs are words we use to connect the ideas between sentences.
Here are some examples of conjunctive adverbs:

> *however*, *therefore*, *nevertheless*

These words share some properties with conjunctions, namely that both types of words connect *ideas*:\

> *I am hungry. However, I won't eat anything.*
>
> *I am hungry, but I won't eat anything.*

In both cases, the words *however* and *but* serve to illustrate that there is a contrast between the first and second ideas.

Unlike conjunctions, however, conjunctive adverbs can actually be moved around to just about anywhere in the sentence.

> I like cats. However, I don't own one.
>
> I like cats. I, however, don't own one.
>
> I like cats. I don't, however, own one.
>
> I like cats. I don't own one, however.

In my experience, just about everyone find the first the most natural and the others a little awkward.
The last version, especially, really triggers most students, who feel that placing *however* at the end of a sentence is just plain wrong.
The College Board knows this. They understand you. But they don't care about your feelings or your future.
So instead of making the correct answer the one that is most natural and most common in English writing, they make the correct answer the one that is the most awkward to say.

I am not guessing. 
Here are the stats for the word however in grammar questions.




Adverbs can be placed in many locations in a sentence.
> I like cats. However, I don't own one. I don't have time to take care of one.
>
> I like cats. I, however, don't own one. I don't have time to take care of one.
>
> I like cats. I don't, however, own one. I don't have time to take care of one.
>
> I like cats. I don't own one, however. I don't have time to take care of one.


:::danger
⛔ Conjunctive adverbs are **not conjunctions** so they can’t join sentences by themselves. They can be used with semicolons, colons, or dashes, however. Here are some examples:

> ❌ *I like cats, however, I don’t own one.*
> 
> ✅ *I like cats; however, I don’t own one.*
> 
> ❌ *I like dogs, for instance, I love Westies.*
> 
> ✅ *I like dogs: for instance, I love Westies.*

Ten years into this stupid test and I still don't know why some things are so hard for people to understand or retain. 
Some things are just hard to get your head around.
