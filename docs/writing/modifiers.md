# Modifier Placement

When we have sentence that begins with a modifier, the phrase that comes right after the comma, needs to be the thing that’s being described.

*Running for the bus, …..* 

We expect a person to come after the comma. So if we have something else after the comma, it’ll sound pretty strange:

*Running for the bus, a banana peal was slipped on by Bob.*

This makes it sound as though the banana peal was running for the bus. That’s obviously wrong. We call this mistake a *****************dangling modifier*****************. What we want is ***Bob*** to come after the comma:

*Running for the bus, **Bob** slipped on banana.*

Try this one:

*Hoping to get a good grade, _________ .*

1. *Bob’s study schedule was intense.*
2. *the study schedule Bob followed was intense.*
3. *Bob followed an intense study schedule.*
