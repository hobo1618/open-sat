# Percents

Percents are an important to understand well.
They may not make up a huge portion of the questions,
but the questions that require you to calculate percentage change
tend to trip-up even the highest performing students.

The good news is that they are mostly easy once you've learnt the
right way of approaching these problems and the most common traps to avoid.

There are two basic operations we perform with percents, 
and it's important to distinguish between the two.

1. Percent *of* questions
2. Percentage *increase* / *decrease* questions.

## Percent *of*

When you are asked to calculate, for example

> What is 5% *of* 125
> What percent *of* 35 is 15?
> 120 is what percent *of* 360?

you are being asked a *percent of* question. 

These are typically more straightforward,
but they are nonetheless the foundation of all the percents questions that follow,
so make sure that these concepts are solid before moving on.

The basic formula for calculating *percent of* questions is this:

> $S*d=F$

where $S$ is the starting number,
$d$ is the percent expressed as a decimal, 
and $F$ is the final result.

For example, the phrase *60% of 25 is 15* could be written as

$$
25*0.6=15
$$

where $25$ is the starting number,
$0.6$ is 60 percent expressed as a decimal, 
and $15$ is the final result.

Understanding how to translate sentences into basic equations with percents is a very valuable skill.
It's one of the few topics on the SAT that I can safely say will serve you well for the rest of your life.
Worth learning well.

There are n basic steps:

1. Identify which variables you know and which one you need to calculate.
2. If you know the percent, convert it to a decimal
3. Plug the numbers into formula above and solve for the unknown.
4. If the percent was the unknown, convert your resulting decimal into a percent.

Let's break it down a little more.

### 1. Identifying the unknowns

The formula is simple enough, but you have to make sure you punch the right numbers into the right spots,
or the whole thing is doomed from the start, of course. 
Fortunately, it's easy enough to get right.

1. The *starting* amount $S$ will have the word *of* glued to its left side.
2. The *percent* will have a percent symbol next to it. 
2. The *final* amount is therefore the remaining value or unknown.
The final amount will also usually be next to the word *is*.


| phrase | variables |
| --- | --- |
| 7 is what percent of 22? | $F=7$, $S=22$, and $d=x\%$ |
| 13% of what number is 11? | $F=11$, $S=x$, and $d=13\%$ |
| What is 45% of 105? | $F=x$, $S=105$, and $d=45\%$ |
| 35 is the result of taking 45% of what number? | $F=35$, $S=x$, and $d=45\%$ |

### 2. Converting percents to decimals

Now we know what's what, but we need to convert the percents into a normal,
and therefore useful, number format: a decimal.

It's really simple.
Just take the percent as a number and move the decimal point two spaces to the left.

> 60% → 60.0 → 0.6
>
> 20% → 20.0 → 0.2
>
> 3% → 3.0 → 0.03
>
> 125% → 125.0 → 1.25

### 3. Plug the numbers into the formula and solve

Now just plug what you know into the formula, and whatever you don't know is your $x$.

| phrase | equation |
| --- | --- |
| 7 is what percent of 22? | $7=d*22$ |
| 13% of what number is 11? | $0.13 * x = 11$ |
| What is 45% of 105? | $x=0.45*105$ |
| 35 is the result of taking 45% of what number? | $35=0.45*x$ |

If the unknown value is the final amount, you are already done.
If you need the percent or the starting amount,
simply isolate the unknown in one step.
For example,

$$
35=0.45*x
$$ 

$$
\frac{35}{0.45}=x
$$ 

### 4. Convert the decimal to a percent

If you've been tasked with finding the percent,
you will need to convert your decimal back into a pecent.
For example,

> 7 is what percent of 22? 
>
> $$
> 7=d*22
> $$
>
> $$
> \frac{7}{22}=x
> $$
>
> $$
> x=0.31818
> $$

So we got an answer, but it's in decimal format.
To convert to a percent,
simply move that decimal point two spaces to the right.

> $0.3181818 = 31.818\%$

And you are done.

## Percent increase / decrease

Questions involving percentage increase or decrease tend to cause students some difficulty.
This is largely because most students have not learnt how to properly handle these types of calculations.
