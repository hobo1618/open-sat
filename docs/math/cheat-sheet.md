## Linear Functions

### Slope formula

Given two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$, the slope of a linear equation is:

$$

m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}

$$

### Slope-intercept Form

Given an equation in the form $y=mx+c$:

- the slope of the line is $m$
- the slope of the perpendicular line is $-1/m$
- the $y$-intercept is $c$
- the $x$-intercept is $-c/m$

### Standard Form

Given an equation in the form $ax+by=k$:

- the $y$-intercept is $k/b$
- the $x$-intercept is $k/a$
- the slope of the line is $-a/b$
- the slope of the perpendicular line is $b/a$

## Quadratic Functions

### General Form

Given a quadratic function in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$:

- the axis of symmetry is at $x=-b/2a$
- the vertex is at $(-b/2a, f(-b/2a))$
- the sum of the solutions is $-b/a$
- the product of the solutions is $c/a$
- the solutions, if they exist, are

$$
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}
$$

- To determine how many solutions a quadratic has:

> $\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac} > 0$ => Two solutions 
> 
> $\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac} = 0$ => One solution
> 
> $\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac} < 0$ => No solutions 

- To determine the distance between the solutions:


$$
\frac{\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{a}
$$

### $x$-intercept Form

Given a quadratic function in the form $f(x)=a(x-p)(x-q)$:

- the solutions are $x=\{p, q\}$
- the axis of symmetry is $\frac{p+q}{2}$
- the coordinates of the vertex are $(\frac{p+q}{2}, f(\frac{p+q}{2}))$
- the product of solutions is $pq$
- the sum of solutions is $p+q$


### Vertex Form

Given a quadratic function in the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$:

- the coordinates of the vertex are $(h, k)$
- the axis of symmetry is $h$
- the solutions, if they exist, are $x=h\pm\sqrt{-\frac{k}{a}}\ $
- if $k=0$, the quadratic has 1 solution
- if $-k/a > 0$, then the quadratic has two solutions
- if $-k/a < 0$, then the quadratic has no solutions
- the product of solutions is $h^{2}+\frac{k}{a}$
- the sum of solutions is $2h$
- the distance between the solutions is $2\sqrt{-\frac{k}{a}}$

## Exponential Functions

Given an exponential function in the form $f\left(x\right)=ab^{kx}+d$:

- the $y$-intercept is $a+d$
- the growth rate is $b$, expressed as a multiplier
  - if $0 < b < 1$, then the function is decreasing.  
  - if $b > 1$, then the function is increasing.  
- $k$ is how many times the function $f$ increases or decreases per step in the $x$.

## Stats & Probability
### Mean
- the mean is the simple or weighted average of a set of numbers:

$$
\bar{x} = \frac{\sum{xf}}{\sum{f}}
$$

Where $x$ is the value of each item and $f$ is the amount of times the item appears (the frequency).

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7\}$, then the mean is:

$$

\bar{x}=\frac{1*1+3*2+1*3+2*5+1*7}{8}

$$

### Mode
Given a set of numbers, the mode is the number that appears most frequently:

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7\}$, then the mode of set $A$ is $2$.

### Median
Given a set of *ordered* numbers, the median is the middle number:

For example, if $A = \{1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7\}$, then the median of set $A$ is $2.5$.

### Standard Deviation
Given a set of numbers, the standard deviation tells us how spread out the data are.
For example, for these two data sets:

$A = \{10, 12, 12, 12, 13, 15, 15, 17\}$

$B = \{1, 5, 7, 12, 13, 18, 22, 27\}$

Both are more or less centered around $12$ but set $B$ has a larger standard deviation because the numbers are more spread out.

You shouldn't ever need to calculate the standard deviation, 
but you should be able to tell which

- mean, median, mode, standard deviation
