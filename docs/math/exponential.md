### Exponential vs Linear Growth

Exponential growth is a type of growth where the rate of change of a variable is proportional to its current value, resulting in an exponential curve. In other words, the value of the variable increases at an accelerating rate over time.

Exponential growth is often used to model phenomena in which the growth rate depends on the size of the population or other variable. For example, the spread of a disease can be modeled with exponential growth, as the more people who are infected, the faster the disease will spread.

In mathematics, exponential growth is described by the function $f\left(x\right)=ab^{x}$ where $a$ is the initial value of the variable, and $b$ is the growth factor or multiplier.

Exponential growth is different from linear growth, in which the rate of change is constant over time. In linear growth, the value of the variable increases at a constant rate over time, resulting in a straight line when plotted on a graph.

### Basic form: $f(x)=ab^x$**

**************************************The $a$ value**

The $a$ value shows 

This is y-intercept. 

**************************************The $b$ value**

This is the multiplier. If you’re given a percentage change, all you have to do is add 100% and then convert your number to a decimal:

+55% change ⇒ 100% + 55% = 155% ⇒ 1.55

-15% change ⇒ 100% - 15% = 85% ⇒ 0.85

+8% change ⇒ 100% + 8% = 108% ⇒ 1.08

| percentage change | multiplier |
| --- | --- |
| +15% | 1.15 |
| +55% | 1.55 |
| +125% | 2.25 |
| +600% | 7 |
| -15% | 0.85 |
| -35% | 0.65 |
| -40% | 0.6 |
| -22% | 0.78 |

******************In word problems******************

$S*m=F$

### Easier versions — going forwards

A shirt is advertised for 60 dollars plus an 8% sales tax. What is the final price of the shirt?

$60  * 1.08=64.8$

A second hand car is advertised for 5000 francs. You are able to bargain down by 12%. What price do you end up paying.

$5000*0.88=4400$

### Harder versions — going backwards

You purchase a t-shirt for 92 dollars, which includes a 13 percent sales tax. What was the original price of the t-shirt?

We don’t know what that the starting amount was, but we know final price ($F = 92)$ and the percentage change (+13%), so we can write this equation:

$S*1.13=92$

$S=\frac{92}{1.13}$

 

### In exponential functions

Let’s say we take a starting amount, and every hour we increase that amount by some percentage. For example, we start with $100 and every hour we increase our fortune by 72%. 

After 0 hours, we have $100

After 1 hour, we have $100 * 1.72 = $172

After 2 hours we have $100 * 1.72 * 1.72 = $295.84

After 3 hours we have $100 * 1.72 * 1.72 * 1.72 = $508.85

We can model this growth with this function:

$f(h)=100(1.72)^h$

### Some examples:

There are 50’000 bacteria in a petridish. Every hour the number of bacteria doubles. How would you model this information?

$B(h)=50000(2)^h$

There is 22’000 radiation at the start of 2024. The amount of radiation halves every year. How would you model this information?

$R(t)=22000(0.5)^t$

### With an additional constant: $f(x)=ab^x+h$

****************************The $h$ value**

$g(x)=42(1.23)^x+10$

What is the y-intercept? If there’s a constant at the end of the function, we have to add that to the $a$ value as well. 

$42+10=52$

### With fractional exponents: $f(x)=ab^{x/k}$

****************************The $k$ value**
