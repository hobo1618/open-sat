## Main Ideas

## Plug-in

Some questions ask us to rearrange an expression into an equivalent form. These questions can vary widely in difficulty, so it’s nice to have a backup plan if the algebra gets messy. 

Consider this question:

$$
\left(\frac{\pi a^{4}}{12r^{3}}\right)\left(\frac{18\pi a^{3}r^{2}}{5}\right)
$$

1. Which expression is equivalent to the given product for all $r \gt 6$ ?
    1. $\frac{3\pi^{2}a^{7}}{10r}$
    2. $\frac{5a}{216r^{5}}$
    3. $\frac{3\pi^{2}a^{7}}{10}$
    4. $\frac{216r^{5}}{5a}$
    
    - **Solution**
        
        You could simplify the expression by cancelling out factors in the numerators and denominators, but if you’re uncomfortable with that approach, desmos is once again here to save the day. All you have to do is write in the initial expression, and allow desmos to create sliders for $a$ and $r$. Then you write in the answer choices and see which one produces the same output:

        In our case, no matter which values you select for $r$ and $a$ , answer choice (A) always produces the same output, so it’s equivalent to the initial expression. Try sliding the knobs around to see the outputs change. See?
        
## Assessing the effect of transformations

The SAT occasionally asks you to consider how a function changes if it’s shifted vertically or horizontally. For example, you could be given a quadratic function like this one:

$$
f(x)=2x^{2}+2x-3
$$

and then asked to find the x-intercepts of $f(x+1)$. The (tactically) WRONG way to go about this would be to substitute $x$ with $x+2$, like so:

$$
f(x+1)=3(x+2)^{2}+2(x+2)-3
$$

and then set $f(x)=-1$ , like so:

$$
-1=3(x+2)^{2}+2(x+2)-3
$$

and solve from there. Sure, it’ll work, but using desmos makes this trivially easy:
