## What calculator should I bring?

To be honest, you don't even have to bring a calculator because the built-in graphics calculator, _desmos_ is so powerful that if you want to use it for entire test, you can.
That said, you will probably want to bring a back-up calculator for minor calculations.

The College Board allows a wide variety of calculators, but we recommend that you bring a calculator you are comfortable using, along a backup calculator and batteries, just in case something goes wrong with your main device. 
Or don't. Because you have _desmos_.
