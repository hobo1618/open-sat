## What calculator should I bring?

Test-takers are allowed a wide variety of calculators, but we recommend that you bring a calculator you are comfortable using, along a backup calculator and batteries, just in case something goes wrong with your main device. 

For a list of acceptable calculators, [follow this link](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy)

A great option for a back-up is a super-simple four function calculator with a solar panel, like this one:

Of course this calculator can‚Äôt do anything fancy ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt have to, because the college board has included desmos (an online graphing calculator) directly in their testing software (see below for more details).
