# What calculator should I bring?

Test-takers are allowed a wide variety of calculators, but we recommend that you bring a calculator you are comfortable using, along a backup calculator and batteries, just in case something goes wrong with your main device. 

For a list of acceptable calculators, [follow this link](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy)

[SAT Calculator Policy](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/sat/what-to-bring-do/calculator-policy)

A great option for a back-up is a super-simple four function calculator with a solar panel, like this one:

Of course this calculator can‚Äôt do anything fancy ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt have to, because the college board has included desmos (an online graphing calculator) directly in their testing software (see below for more details).

# The Desmos App

This section is meant to demonstrate how to effectively use the desmos graphics calculator to your advantage. We‚Äôll look at a wide variety of math problems to showcase the different techniques at your disposal, but we won‚Äôt necessarily slow down to explain the underlying mathematical concepts. If the math is confusing or unclear, try rereading the math theory and coming back to this resource once you have a slightly better grasp of the content.  

## Overview

As mentioned above, the testing software you‚Äôll be using has a built-in graphics calculator called [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) . This graphics calculator is extremely powerful and pleasant to use, so this should be your go-to for any question involving graphing or extensive algebra. For basic arithmetic, we recommend that you stick to a simple, physical calculator like the one pictured above.

Here‚Äôs an embedded example of desmos in use. Feel free to fiddle with the demo below:

## Plotting basic functions & equations

On a regular GDC you can only plot functions with $y=$ something, but desmos offers way more flexibility here. All of the following can be immediately graphed on desmos:

$y=3x+7$

$3x+7$

$f(x)=3x+7$

$2x+7y=9$

$\left(x-2\right)^{2}+\left(y-6\right)^{2}=5$

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è If you want desmos to graph an equation for you, you must use the letters $x$ and $y$ (with some exceptions). Desmos will treat other letters as constants, offering you the option to create a slider (see below).

## Plotting Inequalities

To plot inequalities, simply enter a ‚Äúless than‚Äù, ‚Äúgreater than‚Äù, ‚Äúless than or equal‚Äù, or ‚Äúgreater than or equal‚Äù into the input field. Desmos will shade the area on the $xy$-plane that corresponds to the inequality. 

<aside>
‚ÑπÔ∏è To type a *less than or equal* or *greater than or equal* symbol, you simply type < or > followed by =, and desmos will automatically convert it into ‚â§ or ‚â• .

## Using constants

Desmos allows us to graph equations with unknown constants. This means we can write a function like $f\left(x\right)=ax^{2}+3x-a$ , and desmos will offer us the option to create a slider so we can graph the function with different values of $a$. 

Try changing the value of $a$ by pulling the slider or inputing a value manually:

[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/docorpv0vq](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/docorpv0vq)

You can also click the play button next to the constant and desmos will create an animation by automatically changing the value of the constant, like so:

[https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6cctkhz4ze](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/6cctkhz4ze)

If the range of possible values for the constant is too small, you can change the range manually by clicking on the slider.

## Trigonometry

**Switching between radian and degree modes**

At times you may be asked to provide an answer in either degrees or radians. By default, desmos uses radians. To switch to degrees (or back to radians), simply click the wrench in the top right corner to toggle the menu. At the bottom of the menu, click either ‚Äúradians‚Äù or ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù depending on your needs.

************Trig Functions************

You‚Äôll find all the trig functions you need by toggling the keyboard and then clicking the functions button at the top right hand corner of the keyboard. 

![Screenshot from 2023-01-09 10-43-40.png](/img/desmos/Screenshot_from_2023-01-09_10-43-40.png)

You can also simply type the functions into the input field:

typing sin^-1() is converted to convert it into $\sin^{-1}\left(\right)$

typing cos^-1() is converted to convert it into $\sin^{-1}\left(\right)$

typing tan^-1() is converted to convert it into $\tan^{-1}\left(\right)$

And so on.

Alternatively, you can write inverse trig functions with the ***arc*** prefix:

$arcsin(x)$ is the same as $\sin^{-1}\left(x\right)$

$arcsin(x)$ is the same as $\cos^{-1}\left(x\right)$

$arctan(x)$ is the same as $\tan^{-1}\left(x\right)$

## Plug-in

Some questions ask us to rearrange an expression into an equivalent form. These questions can vary widely in difficulty, so it‚Äôs nice to have a backup plan if the algebra gets messy. 

Consider this question:

$$
\left(\frac{\pi a^{4}}{12r^{3}}\right)\left(\frac{18\pi a^{3}r^{2}}{5}\right)
$$

1. Which expression is equivalent to the given product for all $r \gt 6$ ?
    1. $\frac{3\pi^{2}a^{7}}{10r}$
    2. $\frac{5a}{216r^{5}}$
    3. $\frac{3\pi^{2}a^{7}}{10}$
    4. $\frac{216r^{5}}{5a}$
    
    - **Solution**
        
        You could simplify the expression by cancelling out factors in the numerators and denominators, but if you‚Äôre uncomfortable with that approach, desmos is once again here to save the day. All you have to do is write in the initial expression, and allow desmos to create sliders for $a$ and $r$. Then you write in the answer choices and see which one produces the same output:
        
        [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ilhxiescus](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/ilhxiescus)
        
        In our case, no matter which values you select for $r$ and $a$ , answer choice (A) always produces the same output, so it‚Äôs equivalent to the initial expression. Try sliding the knobs around to see the outputs change. See?
        

## Transformations

The SAT occasionally asks you to consider how a function changes if it‚Äôs shifted vertically or horizontally. For example, you could be given a quadratic function like this one:

$$
f(x)=3x^{2}+2x-3
$$

and then asked to find the x-intercepts of $f(x+2)$. The (tactically) WRONG way to go about this would be to substitute $x$ with $x+2$, like so:

$$
f(x+2)=3(x+2)^{2}+2(x+2)-3
$$

and then set $f(x)=0$ , like so:

$$
0=3(x+2)^{2}+2(x+2)-3
$$

and solve from there. Sure, it‚Äôll work, but using desmos makes this trivially easy:
