    1. In the given quadratic function,Â $a$ andÂ $c$ are constants. The graph ofÂ $y=f(x)$ in theÂ $xy$-plane is a parabola that opens upward and has a vertex at the pointÂ $(h,k)$ whereÂ $h$ andÂ $k$ are constants. IfÂ $k<0$Â andÂ $f(9)=f(3)$, which of the following must be true? (CBD-2-98)
        
        I. $c<0$
        
        II. $a\le1$
        
        1. I only
        2. II only
        3. I and II
        4. Neither I nor II

                $$
                f\left(x\right)=ax^{2}+4x+c \\ f\left(-9\right)=81a-36+c \\ f\left(3\right)=9a+12+c \\ f\left(-9\right)=f\left(3\right) \\  81a-36+c=9a+12+c \\ 81a-36=9a+12 \\  72a=48 \\ a=\frac{48}{72} \\ a=\frac{2}{3}
                $$
                
                Now we plug our value of $a$ back into the original function,
                
                $$
                f\left(x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^{2}+4x+c
                $$
                
                and we consider the other piece of information in the problem, which we have havenâ€™t used yet:
                
                $$
                k<0
                $$
                
                This means that the $[y$-coordinate of the vertex should be less than zero](https://www.notion.so/Quadratic-Equations-Models-Systems-cf5c458f549048d0bf5fafefb39a7cdc?pvs=21). To find the $y$-coordinate of the vertex from the general form, [we can first find the $x$-coordinate by using $-b/2a$](https://www.notion.so/Quadratic-Equations-Models-Systems-cf5c458f549048d0bf5fafefb39a7cdc?pvs=21) . So, given our function:
                
                $$
                f\left(x\right)=\frac{2}{3}x^{2}+4x+c
                $$
                
                the $x$-coordinate of the vertex will be:
                
                $$
                x_{v}=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2\cdot\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)} \\x_{v}=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{\frac{4}{3}}\\x_{v}=-\frac{b}{2a}=-4\cdot\frac{3}{4}=-3\\x_{v}=-3
                $$
                
                Now we plug our value of $x$ into the original function to get the $y$-value of the vertex in terms of $c$
                
                $$
                f\left(-3\right)=y_{v}=\frac{2}{3}\left(-3\right)^{2}+4\left(-3\right)+c \\ y_{v}=\frac{2}{3}\cdot9-12+c \\ y_{v}=6-12+c \\ y_{v}=-6+c
                $$
                
                And we want $y_v<0$ , so we can say that
                
                $$
                -6+c<0 \\ c<6
                $$
                
                and as a reminder, we also have that $a=2/3$. Letâ€™s look at the statements again. The question asks, Which of the following ******must****** be true?
                
                I. $c<0$
                
                II. $a\le1$
                
                1. I only
                2. II only
                3. I and II
                4. Neither I nor II
                
                **Statement I is false** because $c$ could equal $5$, for example, and the parabola would still have its vertex below the $x$-axis.
                
                **Statement II is true** because $2/3 < 1$
