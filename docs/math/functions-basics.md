## Points of Interest

<!-- todo: #enhancement add link to functions page explaining points of interest -->
for this section, you'll need a basic understanding of *points of interest* on a function.
here's a short summary of what is assumed to be prior knowledge:
  - **the solutions** — these are where the quadratic function
  crosses the $x$-axis. they can also be called *$x$-intercepts* or *zeros*.
  a quadratic function can have zero, one, or two solutions,
  depending on where it is placed on the $xy$-coordinate plane.
  - the $y$-intercept — this is where the function crosses the $y$-axis.
  every quadratic function will cross the $y$-axis at some point.
  this is also where the function $f(x)=0$.
  - the vertex, or  — this is where the parabola reaches a minimum or maximum.
  this can also be called the *turning point*.
  at this point, the $x$-coordinate is also the *axis of symmetry*.

the following three sections will look at three different quadratic models, 
how to solve equations in those forms, 
and how to identify or calculate these points of interest.
