# Slope-Intercept Form

## Basic Concepts

Linear equations in slope-intercept form are probably some of the most familiar content
you'll be faced with on the SAT(R).
And yet, unless you are getting close to a perfect score,
you are probably missing out on these questions way more often than you should be.

You should, therefore, take the time to really master this foundational topic
before moving on to other, more complicated topics. 

## The form

A linear relationship is most commonly expressed in this form:

$$
y=mx+c
$$

where $m$ represents the *slope*, or *gradient*,
which tells us how steep the line is, 
and where $c$ represents the $y$-*intercept*,
which tells us where the line hits the $y$-axis.

This form of a linear equation, $y=mx+c$, is known as the *slope-intercept* form.

There are a handful of common tasks you need to complete in questions that test this form:

- Finding the slope from two points
- Finding the $y$-intercept given a point and a slope.
- Finding the $x$-intercept of a line given its equation.
- Calculating the marginal change in $y$ given some change in $y$
- Translating real world scenarios into a linear models and vice-versa

## Finding the slope

Given two points, $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$,
the slope can be calculated with 

$$
m=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{x_{2}-x_{1}}
$$

This is probably the most important single formula on the SAT(R).

Here's a visual representation of

## Real world scenarios

Let’s say you go to play pool with some friends. To rent the pool table you must pay $5 fixed fee plus $3 per hour. How would I write this as a function?

$C(h)=3h+5$

The slope is the rate of change. 
If you see language like “per”, “each”, “every”, “additional”, “increase”, “decrease”,
you are probably looking at the slope.

The $y$-intercept is the “fixed” amount, “starting amount”, or “initial” amount.
It’s also the value of the function when $x=0$.
