# The General Form: $ax+by=k$
        
The general form of a linear equation is given by:

$$
ax+by=k
$$

## Calculating the slope & $y$-intercept

In this form we can’t simply read the slope of the line from any single constant. Instead we have to do some rearranging:

$$
ax+by=k
$$

$$
by=k-ax
$$

$$
y=\frac{k-ax}{b}
$$

$$
y=\frac{k}{b}-\frac{a}{b}x
$$

Now we have the equation in $y=mx+c$ form, where:

$$
m=-\frac{a}{b}
$$

$$
c=\frac{k}{b}
$$

The slope and y-intercepts can then be found quite quickly:

$$
5x+7y=8\\m=-\frac{5}{7},\ c=\frac{8}{7}
$$

$$
6x-9y=7\\m=-\frac{5}{-9}=\frac{2}{3}\\c=\frac{7}{-9}=-\frac{7}{9}
$$

$$
7y-5x=10,\\m=-\frac{\left(-5\right)}{7}=\frac{5}{7}\\c=\frac{10}{-5}=-2
$$

## Real World Modelling Applications (word problems)

Given an equation in the form $ax+by=k$ , the coefficents $a$ and $b$  typically represent the value of each item, while $x$ and $y$ typically represent the number of each type of item. The constant $k$, therefore, represents the total value of all items. 

Say you’re told that at a bake sale cookies are selling for 2 dollars a piece while muffins are selling for 3 dollars a piece. If the seller makes a total of 122 dollars at the end of the day, we can summarize this information with the equation:

$$
2x+3y=122
$$

**Let’s break it apart:**

For the cookies, we have:

>    $x$ ⇒ this represents the number of cookies sold
>    
>    $2$ ⇒ this represents the price per cookie
>    
>    $2x$ ⇒ this represents *price* x *quantity* of the cookies sold — the total money earned from selling cookies, in other words.
>    
>    For the muffins, we have:
>    
>    $y$ ⇒ this represents the number of cookies sold
>    
>    $3$ ⇒ this represents the price per cookie
>    
>    $3y$ ⇒ this represents *price* x *quantity* of the muffins sold — the total money earned from selling muffins, in other words.

The total earnings from sales of cookies and muffins, therefore, is

$2x+3y$

which is equal to $122$. This gives us the final equation of

$2x+3y=122$

We might also be told that the seller sold a total of $50$  cookies and muffins that day. In this case the equation is even more straightforward:

cookies sold $(x)$ + muffins sold $(y)$ = total items sold $(50)$

$x+y=50$

Finally, we might be told that the seller sold 34 more muffins than they did cookies. In this case

muffins sold $(y)$ $-$ cookies sold $(x)$ = the difference $(34)$

$y-x=34$

******************Careful….******************

Why do we do $y-x=34$ in this case, rather than $x-y=34$ ? This is a very easy mistake to make. The easiest way to get this right consistently is to ************************************************************always subtract the smaller amount from the larger amount to get the difference.************************************************************ 

******Examples******

****************Bob is seven centimeters taller than Steve.****************

Bob (taller person) $-$ Steve (shorter person) = difference (7cm)

$b-s=7$

*Molloy $(m_1)$ has five fewer rocks than Malone $(m_2)$.*

Malone ($m_2$ ⇒ has more rocks) $-$ Molloy ($m_1$ ⇒ has fewer rocks) = difference (5 rocks)

$m_2-m_1=5$

*There are 207 more rabbits on Ruth’s farm than there are on Janice’s farm.* 

Ruth (more rabbits) $-$ Janice (fewer rabbits) = difference (207 rabbits)

$r-j=207$

    - ****************Solution****************
        
        When you see a problem with a two types of things (in this case “easy” 1-point questions and “hard” 3-point questions) and these things have a value associated with them (1-point per “easy” questions and 3-points per “hard” question), we can express this using the general form:
        
        $ax+by=c$ ,
        
        where $x$ and $y$ represent the number of easy and hard questions, respectively, and $a$ and $b$  represent the value of each question, respectively. In other words:
        
        $x$ ⇒ number of easy questions
        
        $y$ ⇒ number of hard questions
        
        $a=1$ ⇒ points per easy question
        
        $b=3$ ⇒ points per hard question
        
        $1x$ ⇒ total points from easy questions
        
        $3y$  ⇒ total points from hard questions
        
        and finally…
        
        $1x+3y$ ⇒ total points achieved from both types of questions. 
        
        Since the total amount of points on the test is $70$, we can say that….
        
        $1x+3y=70$
        
        ******************************************************So (D) is the right answer.******************************************************

    - ****************Solution****************
        
        In this problem, we’re given a linear model in the general form: $ax+by=k$. We know that $a$ and $b$  typically represent the value of each item, while $x$ and $y$ typically represent the number of each type of item. So with that in mind, let’s look at the text and the equation:
        
        $2x+35y=3,934$
        
        where $3,934$ represents the total number of trees in the neighborhood; where $2$ represents the number of hectares of park; and where $35$ represents the number of hectares of residential area. 
        
        Since the total ($3,934)$ represents the number of trees, then $2x$ and $35y$ must also represent numbers of trees:
        
        $2x$ ⇒ total number of trees in the 2-hectare park
        
        $35y$ ⇒ total number of trees in the 35-hectare residential area
        
        So if $2x$ represents the number of trees in a 2-hectare park, then $x$ by itself must represent the number of trees in 1-hectare of park, **which is answer choice (A)**

        Whenever you’re given the graph of a linear function and asked to figure out its equation, the best option is often to calculate the slope of the line and compare it to the slopes of the various options. In this case the slope of the linear function in the graph can be easily calculated using:
        
        $$
        m=\frac{rise}{run}=-\frac{40}{60}=-2/3
        $$
        
        :::warning
        ⚠️ **Careful with the negatives here!** The slope is clearly negative because it is sloping downwards, so be careful not to wind-up with $+2/3$ !
        :::
        
        Now all we have to do is compare this value to the given slopes:
        
        1. $y=8x+12$  ⇒  $m=8\neq -2/3$ , so this is incorrect
        2.  $8x+12y=240$*  ⇒  $m=-8/12= -2/3$ , so this could be correct
        3.  $y=12x+8$  ⇒  $m=12\neq -2/3$ , so this is incorrect
        4.  $12x+8y=240$*  ⇒  $m=-12/8\neq -2/3$ , so this is incorrect
        
        :::info
        ℹ️ *Given the general form of a line: $ax+by=k$ , the slope can be easily calculated using $m=-a/b$
        :::
        
        Since the only option with the correct gradient is (B), then it must be the correct answer!

    - ****************Solution****************
        
        ************************The SLOW way************************
        
        The graph of the given system of equations is a perpendicular line, so we can say that the slope of one line must be the negative reciprocal of the other:
        
        $m_1=-1/m_2$
        
        The slope of the first line, using the fact that $m=-a/b$ for equations in the general form, is therefore:
        
        $m_1=-5/7$
        
        and the slope of the second line is therefore:
        
        $m_2=7/5$
        
        Since the slope of the second line is also $m=-a/b$ , we can say that:
        
        $$
        m_2=\frac{7}{5}=-\frac{a}{b}
        $$
        
        $$
        \frac{a}{b}=-\frac{7}{5}
        $$
        
        Now we need to check each answer choice and elimate those of which have $a$ and $b$  in the wrong proportion, i.e where $a/b \neq 7/5$. To speed things up a little, we can use the fact that, given an equation in the general form $ax+by=k$, the slope of any perpendicular line will be $m=b/a$. So….
        
        **Answer choice A**
        
        Any line perpendicular to the first line, $10x+7y=1$ , will have a slope of $7/10$. The second line, $ax-2by=1$, has a slope of $m=a/2b$. We can therefore say that:
        
        $$
        \frac{a}{2b}=\frac{7}{10}
        $$
        
        Now we want to isolate $a/b$ so we can compare it to our initial result. We can isolate $a/b$ by simply multiplying by $2$ on both sides:
        
        $$
        2*\frac{a}{2b}=\frac{7}{10}*2
        $$
        
        $$
        \frac{a}{b}=\frac{7}{5}
        $$
        
        This is close, but we want $a/b=-7/5$ , not positive $7/5$. So we eliminate (A) and move on to (B)
        
        **Answer choice B**
        
        The first line is the same, so its slope is still $7/10$. The second line, $ax+2by=1$, has a slope of $m=-a/2b$. We can therefore say that:
        
        $$
        -\frac{a}{2b}=\frac{7}{10}
        $$
        
        Now we want to isolate $a/b$ so we can compare it to our initial result. We can isolate $a/b$ by simply multiplying by $-2$ on both sides:
        
        $$
        -2*-\frac{a}{2b}=\frac{7}{10}*-2
        $$
        
        $$
        \frac{a}{b}=-\frac{7}{5}
        $$
        
        Which is what we wanted! These two lines, as well as the initial two, will be perpendicular to eachother, so this is the right answer and we don’t need to do any more checking. Thankfully because that was kind of gross. 
        
        **************************The FAST way**************************
        
        Use desmos. 
        
        1. Start by plotting the initial system of equations, creating sliders for $a$ and $b$.
        2. Select values for these constants that produce a set of perpendicular lines. Any set of values in the ratio of $a/b=-7/5$ will work.
        3. Now plot the systems in the answer choices, using your values for $a$ and $b$ (this will happen automatically).
        4. Whichever system produces a pair of perpendicular lines is correct.
        
        Here’s the working out on desmos:
        
        [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/p3xlmu4cww](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/p3xlmu4cww)
        
        If you turn on both equations in answer choice (B), you’ll a pair of perpendicular lines appear on the graph. So (B) is the right answer!
