# Content Overview

SOURCE: All content in this section (Content Overview) is taken directly from the college board. I didn’t write any of this, in other words, nor would I want to pretend I did. To read the full document, click the link below:

## Reading & Writing Content

### Domains Tested

From the College Board

> Questions on the Reading and Writing Section represent one of four content domains:
> 
> - **Craft and Structure**: Measures the comprehension, vocabulary, analysis, synthesis, and reasoning skills and knowledge needed to understand and use high-utility words and phrases in context, evaluate texts rhetorically, and make connections between topically related texts.
> - **Information and Ideas**: Measures comprehension, analysis, and reasoning skills and
> knowledge and the ability to locate, interpret, evaluate, and integrate information and
> ideas from texts and informational graphics (tables, bar graphs, and line graphs)
> - **Standard English Conventions**: Measures the ability to edit texts to conform to core
> conventions of Standard English sentence structure, usage, and punctuation.
> - **Expression of Ideas**: Measures the ability to revise texts to improve the effectiveness of written expression and to meet specific rhetorical goals
> 
> Questions from all four domains appear in each Reading and Writing test module, beginning with Craft and Structure questions and then continuing through Information and Ideas, Standard English Conventions, and Expression of Ideas questions. Questions within the Craft and Structure, Information and Ideas, and Expression of Ideas content domains that test similar skills and knowledge are grouped together to reduce the need for context switching and arranged from easiest to hardest. This makes it easier for students to budget their time and allows each test taker the best opportunity to show what they know and can do. Questions in the Standard English Conventions content domain are arranged from easiest to hardest regardless of which specific convention is being tested. Table 2 provides a breakdown of question distribution by content domain.

## Math Content

### Domains Tested

From The College Board:

> Questions on the Math section represent one of four content domains:
> 
> - **Algebra**: Measures the ability to analyze, fluently solve, and create linear equations and
> inequalities as well as analyze and fluently solve equations and systems of equations
> using multiple techniques
> - **Advanced Math**: Measures skills and knowledge central for progression to more
> advanced math courses, including demonstrating an understanding of absolute value,
> quadratic, exponential, polynomial, rational, radical, and other nonlinear equations
> - **Problem-Solving and Data Analysis**: Measures the ability to apply quantitative
> reasoning about ratios, rates, and proportional relationships; understand and apply unit
> rate; and analyze and interpret one- and two-variable data
> - **Geometry and Trigonometry**: Measures the ability to solve problems that focus on area and volume; angles, triangles, and trigonometry; and circles (NOTE: PSAT 8/9 doesn’t include trigonometry questions.
> 
> Questions from all four content domains appear in each test module. Across each module,
> questions are arranged from easiest to hardest, allowing each test taker the best opportunity
> to demonstrate what they know and can do. Table 3 provides an overview of the question
> distribution by content domain.

# Structure

The SAT is now adaptive, meaning that the difficulty of the questions changes depending on your performance. The test follows what’s called a multi-stage adaptive model: all students are given the same first module, which includes a broad mix of questions; depending on how well a student does on this first module, the second module will either consist of slightly easier or slightly harder questions. 

In the SAT students take a total of four modules: two in **Reading & Writing,** and two in ****Math,**** as shown in the table below:

| Module | Difficulty | Questions | Mins | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Reading & Writing | standard | 27 | 32 | All test-takers receive the same questions for this section. |
| 2. Reading & Writing | adapted | 27 | 32 | Test-takers receive different questions based on their performance in section 1. In other words, the better you do in section 1, the harder the questions are in section 2. |
| 3. Math | standard | 22 | 35 | All test-takers receive the same questions for this section. |
| 4. Math | adapted | 22 | 35 | Test-takers receive different questions based on their performance in section 3. In other words, the better you do in section 3, the harder the questions are in section 4. |

# Scoring

## Section & Combined Scoring

|  | Raw score | Scaled score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reading & Writing | out of 54 | out of 800 |
| Math | out of 44 | out of 800 |
| COMBINED |  | out of 1600 |

## Score Conversion

In the past, the College Board provided score conversion tables, which allowed students to see how raw scores were mapped to scaled scores. With the new format, this is no longer the case, and the relationship between raw scores and scaled scores is not entirely clear. With the information we have, however, the scoring system appears to be similar: one question equates to roughly 5 - 10 points for mid-level scores, and to roughly 10 - 20 points for higher level scores.

Check out the scoring documents at the link below for more detail. While these documents don’t directly show how the digital format is scored, they do allow you to score paper-based versions of the new SAT.
