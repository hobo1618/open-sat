# General Tips & Strategies

## Keeping focused
- reading only the task
- what do I mean by the task? The task is essentially the _question_ part of the question.
- When you read the task first, you will subconsciously start searching through past experience and recalling ideas that could be helpful. 
- It also keeps you lazer focused on what matters the most, i.e. what you are looking for.

## Working quickly
- Working quickly means cutting out steps.
- cutting out steps takes less energy.
- fewer chances to go wrong.


## Prioritizing
- you probably only need to be working on a small set of questions.
