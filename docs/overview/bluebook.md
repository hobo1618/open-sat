# Bluebook

The SAT is now administered on an application called Bluebook. The app can be downloaded here:

[Digital SAT Practice in Bluebook™](https://satsuite.collegeboard.org/digital/digital-practice-preparation/practice-tests/bluebook)

It’s available on windows and mac (but not linux).

# Best Practices

:::info
ℹ️ **Keep the eliminator mode on by default** and get into the habit of eliminating options that are obviously trash.
:::


:::info
ℹ️ **Make sure to bookmark questions that you’ve skipped.** It’ll make it way easier to find these questions when you review your answers later.
:::

:::info
ℹ️ I recommend you learn keyboard shortcuts for the following actions:

- **Next question:**
    - PC ⇒ Ctrl + Alt + X
    - Mac ⇒ Cmd + Ctrl + X
- **Previous question**
    - PC ⇒ Ctrl + Alt + N
    - Mac ⇒ Cmd + Ctrl + B
- **Select/Deselect option A, B, C, or D**
    - PC ⇒ Ctrl + Shift + 1, 2, 3, or 4
    - Mac ⇒ Cmd + Ctrl + 1, 2, 3, or 4
- **Eliminate/Uneliminate option A, B, C, or D**
    - PC ⇒ Ctrl + Alt + 1, 2, 3, or 4
    - Mac ⇒ Cmd + Optn + 1, 2, 3, or 4
- **Open/Close calculator** ⇒ Ctrl + Alt + C
:::

:::warning
⚠️ If you get a “Something’s Wrong” error when you try to load Bluebook, try clicking “sign in with a different user”, then reenter your credentials. That might solve the issue!
:::


:::danger
🚫 **AVOID using annotations.** Highlighting text is generally time consuming, and the texts are typically short enough that you won’t need to make any annotations. However, highlighting text can be helpful if you decide to skip the question and come back to it later. A string of annotated text in this case can help you more quickly recall the main idea of the question when you return to it.

# Notes on Digital Testing

## Devices

> Students can take the digital SAT Suite tests on a wide range of devices, including their own laptops (Windows or MacOS), iPads, school-owned desktops and laptops, and school managed Chromebooks. Students will take the digital SAT Suite using a custom-built digital testing application that they’ll download in advance of test day.

## Borrowing a device

> Students taking the SAT on a weekend who do not have access to a device can request to borrow one from College Board, and we’ll provide one for use on test day. This applies to students taking the SAT on the weekend internationally as well as in the United States. Students will request a device when they register for the SAT. More information about borrowing a device will be available when registration opens for the digital SAT in fall of 2022.

> 

## Internet Connectivity & Battery Life

> Students will connect to the test center’s or school’s internet to start and complete testing. The exam application has been built to withstand internet outages. If the internet connection drops during testing, students will still be able to progress through the test with no disruption. If a student’s computer battery runs down, they can simply plug in, restart their device, and pick up where they left off—all their work will be saved, and they won’t lose testing time. Students will be responsible for bringing their device fully charged on test day, as there may be limited access to power outlets in their testing room.
