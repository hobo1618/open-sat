# Boundaries

:::info
ℹ️ **These questions require you to understand whether a sentence is complete or not**. A full sentence must contain at least one independent clause.
:::

:::info
ℹ️ There are 3 types of boundaries questions**: punctuation** questions**; verb activation** questions**;** and **conjunctions, relative pronouns,** and **demotion questions.**  The can be identified by these features

- **Verb activation questions** (as opposed to conjugation and verb agreement questions) will include only one answer choice with an active verb (*****runs)*****, and three answer choices with inactive verbs (**************to run, running, having run**************).
- **Punctuation questions** require you to choose between a **semicolon**, **colon**, **dash,** and **********comma**********.
- ******Relative pronoun questions****** will include at least one answer choice with *************which, that,************* or ****who,**** and at least one answer choice **without** **************************which, that************************** **or** **************************who.**************************
:::

:::info
ℹ️ Trust your ear to tell you what is or isn’t a full sentence.
:::

:::tip
✅ In terms of English syntax, **semicolons and periods are always interchangeable**. And since we cannot ever have two correct answers on the SAT, if you see two answer choices that are identical except one uses a period and the other uses a semicolon, **they must both be incorrect.**
:::

:::danger
⛔ Yes, colons are good at introducing lists, but **DON’T FALL FOR THIS COMMON TRAP**: colons must still have a full sentence on their LHS even they are introducing a list. **If the LHS isn’t a complete sentence, the colon is simply wrong**.
:::

:::danger
⛔ Conjunctive adverbs are ********************************not conjunctions******************************** so they can’t join sentences by themselves. They can be used with semicolons, colons, or dashes, however. Here are some examples:

❌ *********************I like cats, however, I don’t own one.*********************

✅ *****************I like cats; however, I don’t own one.*****************

❌ *****************I like dogs, for instance, I particularly love Westies.*****************

✅ *****************I like dogs: for instance, I particularly love Westies.*****************

:::

:::info
ℹ️ Colons and dashes each require a full sentence on the left hand side, **************************************************************but they are not totally interchangeable.************************************************************** The colon, generally speaking, is less versatile than the dash. In other words if you’re stuck between the two, the dash is probably the better guess.
:::

:::info
ℹ️ When two full sentences are incorrectly joined with a comma, we call this a ************************comma splice************************ or ******************************run-on sentences******************************.

# Are these fragments or full sentences?

| Fragment | Full Sentence |
| --- | --- |
|  | I like cats. |
| Because I like cats. | Because I like cats, I own several. |
| The car which is blue. | The car is blue.
The car, which is blue, is very fast. |
|  | This is good. |
|  | It is blue. |
| Running for the bus | I was running for the bus. |
| Running for the bus | Running for the bus makes you sweat. |
| Running for the bus | Running for the bus, Bob got tired. |
|  |  |

# Activating the Verb

## Theory

### Basic Example

Complete sentences in English must have at least one active verb. The SAT tests this concept with questions in this structure:

***********************************************Running for the bus, Bob ___________ on a banana peal.***********************************************

1. ******slipping******
2. *******to slip*******
3. *******slipped*******
4. **************having slipped**************

The correct answer here is (C) because it is the only option that forms a complete sentence: 

*************************Running for the bus, Bob slipped on a banana peal.*

The verb *******to slip******* is only active if it is conjugated, which generally means it must have *********a subject*********. In the case above, ***Bob*** is the subject, i.e. ***Bob*** performed the action (Bob *******slipped*******.)

### Identifying verb activation questions

Verb activation questions (as opposed to conjugation and verb agreement questions) will include only one answer choice with an active verb (*****runs*****, for example*****)*****, and three answer choices with inactive verbs (**************to run, running, having run,************** for example).

Say you are given these four answer choices:

1. *smoke*
2. *to smoke*
3. *smoking*
4. *being smoked*

Only one option contains an active (conjugated) verb ⇒ answer choice (A). This means that the question is asking you to identify whether or not we want to have an active verb here. And most of the time, the active verb option will be the correct one, although you should always tread carefully and actually read the sentence carefully.

### Listening for the active verb

These questions are typically on the easier end of the spectrum, and you should trust your ear to tell you what is or isn’t a complete sentence. 

**Here are some examples**

| active verb (independent clause) | inactive verb (fragment) |
| --- | --- |
| it is blue.
it was blue.
It will be blue.
it has been blue.
It will have been blue.
it had been blue. | It being blue.
it having been blue.
It to be blue. |
| You walk.
You walked.
You will walk.
You have been walking.
You will have been walking.
You had been walking. | You walking.
You having walked.
You to walk |
|  |  |
| The woman running for President is rich.
The woman running for President was rich.
The woman running for President will be rich.
The woman running for President has been rich.
The woman running for President will have been rich.
The woman running for President had been rich.
 | The woman running for President.
The woman to run for President.
The woman running for President being rich.
The woman running for President to be rich. |

If you find you’re having difficulty telling the difference, I recommend you try reading outloud more often, listening for the main verb or verbs in a sentence. You can also consult a more traditional grammar resource, but I would not recommend that you get lost in grammar rules. If you are generally getting these questions right, you shouldn’t waste time learning the details of grammar — you’ll find it’s way too much information for the SAT and almost certainly not helpful.

## Exercises

- ****************Question 1****************
    
    
    Some people buy organic food because they believe organically grown crops are more nutritious and safer for consumption than their conventionally grown counterparts, which are usually produced with pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. In the name of health, _______ $1.60 for every dollar they would have spent on food that is conventionally grown.
    
    1. spending
    2. these consumers spend
    3. having spent
    4. to spend
    - ****************Solution****************
        
        The correct answer is (B) because it’s the only option with a subject (***************these consumers***************) and an active verb (*****spend*****). 
        
    
- **Question 2**
    
    
    Explaining his company’s decision to expand its tuition-assistance program, John Fox, the director of dealer training at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the United States, ____________ the importance of drawing skilled employees to Fiat Chrysler’s car dealerships: “This is a benefit that can surely bring top talent to our dealers,” he said.

    - **Solution**
        
        The correct answer is (B)  because it’s the only option with an active verb (*****stressed*****). 
        
    

# Punctuation

## Theory

### Basic Example

The rules for joining clauses with punctuation are generally not taught in school, so even proficient English speakers struggle with these questions at first. The good news is that the rules are simple enough to learn and generally easy to apply. Here’s simplified example of boundaries question with punctuation:

*Hoping to get a good ______ I studied every day.*

1. *grade,*
2. *grade;*
3. *grade—*
4. *grade:*

The correct answer here is (A) because semi-colons, dashes, and colons must all have a full sentence on their left hand side. **************************Hoping to get a good grade************************** is not a full sentence, so (B), (C), and (D) must all be incorrect, which leaves us with answer choice (A).

Let’s look at each punctuation mark more closely

### Semicolons and periods

In terms of English syntax, semicolons ( ; ) and periods, or full-stops,  ( . ) are completely interchangeabe. In other words, both should be used to seperated complete sentences from one another. These sentences, therefore,

✅ *I like cats. You like dogs.*

✅ *I like cats; you like dogs.*

are both correct because there is a full sentence on both the right and left hand side of the punctuation mark.

These sentences, meanwhile,

❌ *I spent last summer in Paris. A beautiful city.*

❌ *I spent last summer in Paris; a beautiful city.*

are both incorrect because the right hand side of the punctuation mark contains a fragment.

Similarly,

*❌ Running for the bus. I slipped.*

*❌ Running for the bus; I slipped.*

are both incorrect because the left hand side is a fragment.

If you are given these answer choices, therefore

1. pickles;
2. pickles.
3. pickles,
4. pickles—

you can safely delete answer choices (A) and (B). They cannot both be right so they must both be wrong!

### Exception

Semicolons can also be used to delimit items in long, complicated lists where each item contains one or more commas. For example, if we have a short list like this:

*I like Mexican food, French food, and Italian food.*

The list and its items are clearly visible.

But if we add a bunch of details to the list, it can get unruly pretty quickly:

*I like Mexican food for its bold flavors, spice, and acidity, French food for its refined dishes and history, and Italian food for its high quality ingredients, tradition, and cheese.*

To make this clearer, let’s add semicolons between items:

*I like Mexican food for its bold flavors, spice, and acidity; French food for its refined dishes and history; and Italian food for its high quality ingredients, tradition, and cheese.*

### Colons

**Colons must have an independent clause on their LHS**. On their RHS they can have either a fragment or a full sentence. All of these sentences, therefore

*✅ I quit for a good reason: my boss was evil.*

✅ *I love all kinds of movies: horrors, comedies, and romances.*

*✅ The key to health and happiness can be summed up in one word: fondue.*

are correct because the LHS of each colon could form a stand-alone sentence.

These examples, meanwhile,

*❌ Poker: it’s a wonderful game.*

*❌ Last night at the disco: we danced all night.*

*❌ Earlier I went shopping for: bread, bananas, and yogurt.*

*❌ I love films such as: horrors, comedies, and romances*

are all incorrect because the LHS of each colon does not form a complete sentence. But wait — aren’t colons good for introducing lists?

To fix these:

*❌ Earlier I went shopping for: bread, bananas, and yogurt.*

*❌ I love films such as: horrors, comedies, and romances*

We can make the LHS into a full sentence:

✅ *Earlier I went shopping for **these items**: bread, bananas, and yogurt.*

✅ *I love films such as **these**: horrors, comedies, and romances*

### Dashes

Dashes are pretty similar to colons in some ways, but the two differ in some important ways as well. For now let’s keep it simple and say that a dashe, like a colon, must have an independent clause on its LHS. On its RHS it can have either a fragment or a full sentence. All of these sentences, therefore

✅ *I love all kinds of movies—horrors, comedies, and romances.*

*✅ I quit for a good reason—my boss was evil.*

*✅ The key to health and happiness can be summed up in one word—fondue.*

are correct because the LHS of each dash could form a stand-alone sentence.

These examples, meanwhile,

*❌ Poker—It’s a wonderful game.*

*❌ Last night at the disco—we danced all night.*

*❌ Earlier I went shopping for—bread, bananas, and yogurt.*

*❌ I love films such as—horrors, comedies, and romances*

are all incorrect because the LHS of each colon does not form a complete sentence. 

### So what are the differences between colons and dashes, then?

1. **Dashes are more versatile than colons**
    
    Occasionally on harder questions you’ll be faced with a choice between a colon and dash, where both options have a full sentence on the LHS of the punctuation. In other words, the rules mentioned above are not sufficient to solve the problem. Here is an example:
    
    1. *I was bored at the wedding: so I went home.*
    2. *I was bored at the wedding—so I went home.*
    
    Both options have a complete sentence on their LHS, so what’s the right answer here? The key here is that colons are very rarely followed by conjunctions (words like ***********************so, and, but, because***********************) whereas this isn’t a problem with dashes. 
    
2. ********************************************Dashes can come in pairs********************************************
    
    Dashes, unlike colons, can sometimes come in pairs. In other words, you might find a sentence with two dashes in it, like this one:
    
    ✅ *Bob—my best friend—is French.*
    
    This sentence is correct because the dashes are being used as brackets, so rule about how a dash must have a complete sentence on its left no longer applies.
    

### Commas

Commas are tricky in English. In this short section we’ll be looking ********ONLY******** at the rules governing comma usage between clauses. The basic rule is that a comma ************cannot************ join two complete sentences. These sentences, therefore,

*❌ I like cats, they are fluffy.*

*❌ Geoff got home at 4am, he woke up exhausted.*

*❌ Spain is a beautiful country, its beaches are the best in the world.*

are all incorrect because in each the comma has a full sentence on its right and its left hand sides. 

We can easily fix these run-on sentences in a few different ways.

1. **We can add a conjunction**
    
    *❌ I like cats, they are fluffy.*
    
    ✅ *I like cats ****************because**************** they are fluffy.*
    
2. **We can change the comma into a different punctuation mark**
    
    *❌ Geoff got home at 4am, he woke up exhausted.*
    
    ✅ *Geoff got home at 4am; he woke up exhausted.*
    
    ✅ *Geoff got home at 4am—he woke up exhausted.*
    
    ✅ *Geoff got home at 4am: he woke up exhausted.*
    
3. **We can convert either the left or right hand side into a fragment**
    
    *❌ Spain is beautiful country, its beaches are the best in the world.*
    
    ✅ *Spain is a beautiful country, **its beaches the best in the world**.*
    
    ✅ ***A beautiful country**, Spain has the best beaches in the world.*
    
    ✅ *Spain is a beautiful country, **which has the best beaches in the world**.*
    

### Overview of rules

************Joining two full sentences************

| Full Sentence | connection | Full Sentence | Correct? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| I like cats | . | They are fluffy. | works |
| I like cats | ; (semi-colon) | they are fluffy. | works |
| I like cats | — (dash) | they are fluffy. | works |
| I like cats | : (colon) | they are fluffy. | works |
| I like cats | because (conjunction) | they are fluffy. | works |
| I like cats | , (comma) | they are fluffy. | incorrect — this is known as a comma splice or run-on sentence  |

**********Joining a full sentence to a fragment**********

| Full Sentence | connection | Fragment | Correct? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| This is Bob | . | My best friend. | incorrect |
| This is Bob | ; (semi-colon) | my best friend. | incorrect |

| This is Bob | : (colon) | my best friend. | works |
| I studied for a week straight | , and (conjunction) | hoping to get a good grade. | incorrect |
| This is Bob | , (comma) | my best friend. | works |

**********Joining a fragment to a full sentence**********

    Marsupials (mammals that carry their young in a pouch) are a curiosity among biologists because they lack a corpus callosum, the collection of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. In most other mammals, the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, the right hemisphere controls the left, and the corpus callosum allows communication between the hemispheres. Scientists have long believing that this structure enables complex tasks by sequestering skilled movement to a single hemisphere without sacrificing coordination between both sides of the body; this sequestration would explain handedness, the tendency to consistently prefer one hand over the other, in humans. However, a recent finding of handedness in marsupials suggests that a __________  other than the presence of a corpus callosum correlates with handedness: bipedalism.
