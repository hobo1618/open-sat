# Boundaries
## Introduction
These questions require you to understand whether a sentence is complete or not, and to decide how to fill in the blank based on your assessment.

There are 3 types of boundaries questions: 

1. **Verb activation questions** (as opposed to conjugation and verb agreement questions) will include only one answer choice with an active verb (*runs*), and three answer choices with inactive verbs (*to run, running, having run*).
2. **Punctuation questions** require you to choose between a *semicolon*, *colon*, *dash*, and *comma*.
3. **Relative pronoun questions** will include at least one answer choice with *which, that,* or *who,* and at least one answer choice **without** *which, that* or *who.*

We'll look at all three of these types,
how to identify which type you're dealing with,
what rules you need to know, 
and what the common traps are in each category.

But first, we need to talk about your ear.

## Complete or Incomplete?

In technical terms, a full sentence must contain at least one independent clause, but I generally wouldn't advise that you use spend a lot of time searching for subjects and verbs to assess whether a sentence is complete or not. In my experience the best approach is to simply trust your ear. 

**Here are some examples**

| Clause | Complete? |
| --- | --- |
| it is blue. | yes |
it was blue. | yes |
It will be blue. | yes |
it has been blue. | yes |
It will have been blue | yes |
it had been blue | yes |
It being blue. | yes |
it having been blue. | yes |
It to be blue. | yes |
You walk. | yes |
You walked. | yes |
You will walk. | yes |
You have been walking. | yes |
You will have been walking. | yes |
You had been walking.  | yes |
You walking. | yes |
You having walked. | yes |
You to walk | yes |
The woman running for President is rich. | yes |
The woman running for President was rich. | yes |
The woman running for President will be rich. | yes |
The woman running for President has been rich. | yes |
The woman running for President will have been rich. | yes |
The woman running for President had been rich. | yes |
The woman running for President. | yes |
The woman to run for President. | yes |
The woman running for President being rich. | yes |
The woman running for President to be rich. | yes |
I like cats. | yes |
Because I like cats.  | yes |
Because I like cats, I own several. | yes |
The car which is blue. | yes |
The car is blue. | yes |
The car, which is blue, is very fast. | yes |
This is good. | yes |
It is blue. | yes |
Running for the bus | yes |
I was running for the bus. | yes |
Running for the bus | yes |
Running for the bus makes you sweat. | yes |
Running for the bus | yes |
Running for the bus, Bob got tired. | yes |

If you find you’re having difficulty telling the difference, I recommend you try reading outloud more often, listening for the main verb or verbs in a sentence. You can also consult a more traditional grammar resource, but I would not recommend that you get lost in grammar rules. If you are generally getting these questions right, you shouldn’t waste time learning the details of grammar — you’ll find it’s way too much information for the SAT and almost certainly not helpful.


## Type 1: Activating the Verb

Complete sentences in English must have at least one active verb. The SAT tests this concept with questions in this structure:

*Running for the bus, Bob ___________ on a banana peal.*

> <ol type="A">
>     <li>*slipping*</li>
>     <li>*to slip*</li>
>     <li>*slipped*</li>
>     <li>*having slipped*</li>
> </ol>

<details>
    <summary>
        Solution
    </summary>

    The correct answer here is (C) because it is the only option that forms a complete sentence: 

    > *Running for the bus, Bob slipped on a banana peal.*

    The verb *to slip* is only active if it is conjugated, which generally means it must have *a subject*. In the case above, *Bob* is the subject, i.e. *Bob* performed the action (Bob *slipped*.)
</details>


### Identification 

Verb activation questions (as opposed to conjugation and verb agreement questions) will include only one answer choice with an active verb (*runs*, for example), and three answer choices with inactive verbs (*to run, running, having run,* for example).

Say you are given these four answer choices:

<ol type="A">
    <li>*smoke*</li>
    <li>*to smoke*</li>
    <li>*smoking*</li>
    <li>*being smoked*</li>
</ol>

Only one option contains an active (conjugated) verb ⇒ answer choice (A). This means that the question is asking you to identify whether or not we want to have an active verb here. And most of the time, the active verb option will be the correct one <span>&mdash;</span> although you should always actually read the sentence carefully.

### Listening for the active verb

These questions are typically on the easier end of the spectrum, and you should trust your ear to tell you what is or isn’t a complete sentence. 

### Exercises

*Question 1*
    
> Some people buy organic food because they believe organically grown crops are more nutritious and safer for consumption than their conventionally grown counterparts, which are usually produced with pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. In the name of health, _______ $1.60 for every dollar they would have spent on food that is conventionally grown.
> <ol type="A">
>     <li>spending</li>
>     <li>these consumers spend</li>
>     <li>having spent</li>
>     <li>to spend</li>
> </ol>

<details>
    <summary>
        Solution
    </summary>
The correct answer is (B) because it’s the only option with a subject (*these consumers*) and an active verb (*spend*). 
</details>


        
        
    
*Question 2*

> Explaining his company’s decision to expand its tuition-assistance program, John Fox, the director of dealer training at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles in the United States, ____________ the importance of drawing skilled employees to Fiat Chrysler’s car dealerships: “This is a benefit that can surely bring top talent to our dealers,” he said.
> <ol type="A">
>     <li>who stressed</li>
>     <li>stressed</li>
>     <li>stressing</li>
>     <li>and he stressed</li>
> </ol>
<details>
    <summary>
        Solution
    </summary>
    The correct answer is (B)  because it’s the only option with an active verb (*stressed*). 
</details>
        
    

## Type 2: Punctuation

### Identification
Identifying these questions is pretty easy.
In short, Boundaries>Punctuation questions require you to choose between:
> <ol type="A">
>     <li>semicolon</li>
>     <li>colon</li>
>     <li>dash</li>
>     <li>comma</li>
> </ol>

If you have to choose between any 2 out of 4 of these punctuation marks,
then you are dealing with a Boundaries>Punctuation question,
and you are in the right place.

The rules for joining clauses with punctuation are generally not taught in school, so even proficient English speakers struggle with these questions at first.
The good news is that the rules are simple enough to learn and generally easy to apply.
Here’s a simplified example of boundaries question with punctuation:

> Hoping to get a good ______ I studied every day.
> 
> <ol type="A">
>     <li>grade,</li>
>     <li>grade;</li>
>     <li>grade—</li>
>     <li>grade:</li>
> </ol>
<details>
    <summary>
        Solution
    </summary>
    The correct answer here is (A) because semi-colons, dashes, and colons must all have a full sentence on their left hand side. *Hoping to get a good grade* is not a full sentence, so (B), (C), and (D) must all be incorrect, which leaves us with answer choice (A).
</details>

Ok, fine, but why? Let’s look at each punctuation mark more closely.

### Semicolons and periods

:::tip
In terms of English syntax, **semicolons and periods are always interchangeable**. And since we cannot ever have two correct answers on the SAT, if you see two answer choices that are identical except one uses a period and the other uses a semicolon, **they must both be incorrect.**
:::

In other words, both periods and semicolons are used to seperated complete sentences from one another. These sentences, therefore,

> ✅ *I like cats. You like dogs.* 
>
> ✅ *I like cats; you like dogs.*

are both correct because there is a full sentence on both the right and left hand side of the punctuation mark.

These sentences, meanwhile,

> ❌ *I spent last summer in Paris. A beautiful city.*
> 
> ❌ *I spent last summer in Paris; a beautiful city.*

are both incorrect because the right hand side of the punctuation mark contains a fragment.

Similarly,

> *❌ Running for the bus. I slipped.*
> 
> *❌ Running for the bus; I slipped.*

are both incorrect because the left hand side is a fragment.

If you are given these answer choices, therefore

> <ol type="A">
>     <li>pickles;</li>
>     <li>pickles.</li>
>     <li>pickles,</li>
>     <li>pickles—</li>
> </ol>

you can safely delete answer choices (A) and (B). They cannot both be right so they must both be wrong!

### Important Exception

Semicolons can also be used to delimit items in long, complicated lists where each item contains one or more commas. For example, if we have a short list like this:

> *I like Mexican food, French food, and Italian food.*

The list and its items are clearly visible.

But if we add a bunch of details to the list, it can get unruly pretty quickly:

> *I like Mexican food for its bold flavors, spice, and acidity, French food for its refined dishes and history, and Italian food for its high quality ingredients, tradition, and cheese.*

To make this clearer, let’s add semicolons between items:

> *I like Mexican food for its bold flavors, spice, and acidity; French food for its refined dishes and history; and Italian food for its high quality ingredients, tradition, and cheese.*

### Colons

:::danger
⛔ Yes, colons are good at introducing lists, but **DON’T FALL FOR THIS COMMON TRAP**: colons must still have a full sentence on their LHS even they are introducing a list. **If the LHS isn’t a complete sentence, the colon is simply wrong**.
:::

**Colons must have an independent clause on their LHS**. On their RHS they can have either a fragment or a full sentence. All of these sentences, therefore

> ✅ *I quit for a good reason: my boss was evil.*
> 
> ✅ *I love all kinds of movies: horrors, comedies, and romances.*
> 
> ✅ *The key to health and happiness can be summed up in one word: fondue.*

are correct because the LHS of each colon could form a stand-alone sentence.

These examples, meanwhile,

> *❌ Poker: it’s a wonderful game.*
> 
> *❌ Last night at the disco: we danced all night.*
> 
> *❌ Earlier I went shopping for: bread, bananas, and yogurt.*
> 
> *❌ I love films such as: horrors, comedies, and romances*

are all incorrect because the LHS of each colon does not form a complete sentence. But wait — aren’t colons good for introducing lists?

To fix these:

> *❌ Earlier I went shopping for: bread, bananas, and yogurt.*
>
> *❌ I love films such as: horrors, comedies, and romances*

We can make the LHS into a full sentence:

> ✅ *Earlier I went shopping for **these items**: bread, bananas, and yogurt.*
> 
> ✅ *I love films such as **these**: horrors, comedies, and romances*

### Dashes

Dashes are pretty similar to colons in some ways, but the two differ in some important ways as well. For now let’s keep it simple and say that a dashe, like a colon, must have an independent clause on its LHS. On its RHS it can have either a fragment or a full sentence. All of these sentences, therefore

> ✅ *I love all kinds of movies—horrors, comedies, and romances.*
> 
> *✅ I quit for a good reason—my boss was evil.*
> 
> *✅ The key to health and happiness can be summed up in one word—fondue.*

are correct because the LHS of each dash could form a stand-alone sentence.

These examples, meanwhile,

> *❌ Poker—It’s a wonderful game.*
> 
> *❌ Last night at the disco—we danced all night.*
> 
> *❌ Earlier I went shopping for—bread, bananas, and yogurt.*
> 
> *❌ I love films such as—horrors, comedies, and romances*

are all incorrect because the LHS of each colon does not form a complete sentence. 

### Dashes vs colons

:::info
ℹ️ Colons and dashes each require a full sentence on the left hand side, **but they are NOT totally interchangeable.** The colon, generally speaking, is less versatile than the dash. In other words if you’re stuck between the two, the dash is probably the better guess.
:::

1. **Dashes are more versatile than colons**
    
    Occasionally on harder questions you’ll be faced with a choice between a colon and dash, where both options have a full sentence on the LHS of the punctuation. In other words, the rules mentioned above are not sufficient to solve the problem. Here is an example:
    
    > *I was bored at the wedding: so I went home.*
    >
    > *I was bored at the wedding—so I went home.*
    
    Both options have a complete sentence on their LHS, so what’s the right answer here? The key here is that colons are very rarely followed by conjunctions (words like *so, and, but, because*) whereas this isn’t a problem with dashes. 
    
2. *Dashes can come in pairs*
    
    Dashes, unlike colons, can sometimes come in pairs. In other words, you might find a sentence with two dashes in it, like this one:
    
    > ✅ *Bob—my best friend—is French.*
    
    This sentence is correct because the dashes are being used as brackets, so rule about how a dash must have a complete sentence on its left no longer applies.
    

### Commas

Commas are tricky in English. In this short section we’ll be looking **ONLY** at the rules governing comma usage between clauses. The basic rule is that a comma **cannot** join two complete sentences. These sentences, therefore,

:::info
ℹ️ When two full sentences are incorrectly joined with a comma, we call this a *comma splice* or *run-on sentences*.
:::

> *❌ I like cats, they are fluffy.*
> 
> *❌ Geoff got home at 4am, he woke up exhausted.*
> 
> *❌ Spain is a beautiful country, its beaches are the best in the world.*

are all incorrect because in each the comma has a full sentence on its right and its left hand sides. 

We can easily fix these run-on sentences in a few different ways.

1. **We can add a conjunction**
    
    > *❌ I like cats, they are fluffy.*
    > 
    > ✅ *I like cats *because* they are fluffy.*
    
2. **We can change the comma into a different punctuation mark**
    
    > *❌ Geoff got home at 4am, he woke up exhausted.*
    > 
    > ✅ *Geoff got home at 4am; he woke up exhausted.*
    > 
    > ✅ *Geoff got home at 4am—he woke up exhausted.*
    > 
    > ✅ *Geoff got home at 4am: he woke up exhausted.*
    
3. **We can convert either the left or right hand side into a fragment**
    
    > *❌ Spain is beautiful country, its beaches are the best in the world.*
    > 
    > ✅ *Spain is a beautiful country, **its beaches the best in the world**.*
    > 
    > ✅ ***A beautiful country**, Spain has the best beaches in the world.*
    > 
    > ✅ *Spain is a beautiful country, **which has the best beaches in the world**.*

#### Question 5
    
> Marsupials (mammals that carry their young in a pouch) are a curiosity among biologists because they lack a corpus callosum, the collection of nerve fibers connecting the two hemispheres of the brain. In most other mammals, the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, the right hemisphere controls the left, and the corpus callosum allows communication between the hemispheres. Scientists have long believing that this structure enables complex tasks by sequestering skilled movement to a single hemisphere without sacrificing coordination between both sides of the body; this sequestration would explain handedness, the tendency to consistently prefer one hand over the other, in humans. However, a recent finding of handedness in marsupials suggests that a __________  other than the presence of a corpus callosum correlates with handedness: bipedalism.

## Type 3: Connectors & Demotion

### Identification

These questions can be a little harder to spot at first
because there is a little more variety in how the answer choices
are presented.

You may, for example, have to choose between:

> <ol type="A">
>     <li>and</li>
>     <li>but</li>
>     <li>however</li>
>     <li>[blank]</li>
> </ol>

Or they may throw some relative pronouns into the mix:

> <ol type="A">
>     <li>which</li>
>     <li>that</li>
>     <li>[blank]</li>
> </ol>

Or the answer choices may look pretty much identical to the [verb activation](#type-1-activating-the-verb) question types we looked at earlier:

> <ol type="A">
>     <li>running</li>
>     <li>that ran</li>
>     <li>run</li>
>     <li>having run</li>
> </ol>

Or you might have a mix of [punctuation](#type-2-punctuation) style options with any of the above:

> <ol type="A">
>     <li>hair, but</li>
>     <li>hair, however,</li>
>     <li>hair;</li>
>     <li>hair, </li>
> </ol>

Let's move on to the concepts, then, and you'll start to see how it all ties together soon.

### Conjunctions

#### Fixing run-on sentences without changing the punctuation

Let’s say you are given a run-on sentence such as this one:

> *❌ I like cats, they are fluffy.*
> 
> ✅ *I like cats *because* they are fluffy.*


| type |  | sample sentences |
| --- | --- | --- |
| coordinating conjunctions | f
a
n
b
o
y
s |  |
| subordinating conjunctions |  |  |


### Demotion

Demotion is when you merge two sentences by converting one of them into a fragment.

For example, these two sentences,
> Last summer I visited France. France is a beautiful country.

could really be merged into a single sentence.
Can you think?

<details>
    <summary>
        How can we merge the two sentences above to be more concise?
    </summary>
    > Last summer I visited France, a beautiful country.

    By *demoting* the second sentence into a fragment, we avoid repetition.
</details>


#### Question 1
    
> 1-MCP is a chemical fruit sellers use to keep their fruits looking fresh. This chemical works by limiting a fruit’s production of ethylene, it is a chemical that causes fruit to ripen and eventually rot.
>     
> <ol type="A">
>     <li>NO CHANGE</li>
>     <li>being</li>
>     <li>that is</li>
>     <li>DELETE the underlined portion</li>
> </ol>

<details>
    <summary>
        Solution
    </summary>
        (D)

</details>
        
#### Question 2
    
> Many librarians, whose training now includes courses on research and Internet search methods, teach classes in Internet navigation, database and software use, and digital information literacy. While these classes are particularly helpful to young students developing basic research skills, but adult patrons can also benefit from librarian assistance in that they can acquire job-relevant computer skills.

### Conjunctive Adverbs

:::danger
⛔ Conjunctive adverbs are **not conjunctions** so they can’t join sentences by themselves. They can be used with semicolons, colons, or dashes, however. Here are some examples:

> ❌ *I like cats, however, I don’t own one.*
> 
> ✅ *I like cats; however, I don’t own one.*
> 
> ❌ *I like dogs, for instance, I love Westies.*
> 
> ✅ *I like dogs: for instance, I love Westies.*
