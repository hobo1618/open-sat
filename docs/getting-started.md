# Welcome to Open SAT

I've been teaching the SAT for 10 years to some of the wealthiest people on the planet. With this website
I aim to document everything I've learned along the way. But this isn't about me. I hope that this will 
quickly become the go to resource for SAT tricks and strategies, and I hope that you will
help that become a reality.

This is an open source project and contributions are always welcome. That could be contributions to the codebase as well as contributions to the educational content. 
If something is poorly worded, unclear, or flat out wrong, we want to know. See the [contributing](getting-started/) section 
for more details on how to help out.

## Motivation

SAT prep is hard. It took me about 5 years before I could confidently say that I was an effective teacher and worth the high hourly rate I was charging. Most of the off-the-shelf 
advice you read or see in YouTube videos is generic, oversold, or nearly impossible to implement. There's also a ton of misinformation and confusion around how scores increase over time,
what a good score improvement looks like, and what factors might make a score more or less likely to change over time. The simple fact is that some of you
won't be able to improve your score without putting in an insane amount of time and effort that would be much better placed in your school work, your extra curriculars, or, you know,
God forbid, having a bit of fun with your friends. 

This project's aim is to cut out all of the BS you will inevitably encounter along the test-prep process. We will never take sponsorship from test-prep companies,
we will never sell courses, and we will never hide information behihnd a paywall. Yes, I do still offer private tuition for a very high hourly rate. This is, after all, my profession. 
But everything I know will eventually be in this website, if it isn't already.
