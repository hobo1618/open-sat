# Welcome to Open SAT

I've been teaching the SAT for 10 years.
With this website I aim to document everything I've learned along the way.
But this isn't about me.
I hope that this will eventually become the go to resource for SAT tricks and strategies, and I hope that you will help that become a reality.

This is an open source project and contributions are always welcome. That could be contributions to the codebase as well as contributions to the educational content. 
If something is poorly worded, unclear, or flat out wrong, let me know. See the [contributing](getting-started#contributing) section for more details on how to help out.

## Motivation

SAT prep is hard. It took me about 5 years before I could confidently say that I was an effective teacher and worth the high hourly rate I was charging.
Most of the off-the-shelf advice you read or see in YouTube videos is generic, oversold, or nearly impossible to implement.
There's also a ton of misinformation and confusion around how scores increase over time,
what a good score improvement looks like, and what factors might make a score more or less likely to change over time.
The simple fact is that some of you won't be able to improve your score without putting in an insane amount of time and effort that would be much better placed in your school work, your extra curriculars, or, you know, God forbid, having a bit of fun with your friends. 

This project's aim is to cut out all of the BS you will inevitably encounter along the test-prep process.
Open prep will never take sponsorship from test-prep companies and we will never hide information behihnd a paywall.
Yes, I do still offer private tuition.
This is, after all, my profession. 
But everything I know will eventually be in this website, if it isn't already.

## So what's in the box?

### Content
Where you are right now. If you keep pressing next after each page, you'll move through the content in order from most general / basic to most complex/specific. Kind of. It's not as easy as it sounds to put concepts in order of difficulty, believe it or not.

### Blog posts
The blog is for content that doesn't fit easily into a learning path, such as broader discussions about testing fairness (cough), tips on keeping focused, or whatever else. Video content posted to
YouTube will also be posted here, along with a short explanation of the ideas covered.

### Live streams
Every Sunday at 8pm CET (Paris, Madrid) I'll be doing a 90-minute live stream where I answer your questions, explain some concept that's been on my mind, comment on bad test-prep advice, or just work on this site.

### Discord
We're on Discord!
If you want to chat with others about whatever, that's the place to do it. 

## Contributing
Are you a teacher or developer?
The more help we can get the better.
If you've got an idea for a feature or if you'd like to try your hand at writing some content, open a PR!
If you're a teacher with no coding experience at all, and that last sentence went right over your head, I'll be posting a tutorial for how to propose changes or ideas for content.
