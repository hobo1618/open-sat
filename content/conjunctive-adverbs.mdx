Conjunctive adverbs are words we use to connect the ideas between sentences.
Here are some examples of conjunctive adverbs:

> *however*, *therefore*, *nevertheless*

These words share some properties with conjunctions, namely that both types of words connect *ideas*:\

> *I am hungry. However, I won't eat anything.*
>
> *I am hungry, but I won't eat anything.*

In both cases, the words *however* and *but* serve to illustrate that there is a contrast between the first and second ideas.

Despite the name, though, *conjunctive adverbs* are not conjunctions, but adverbs.
In other words, they**cannot** join full sentences on their own.

Adverbs in general are **always optional**.
If you see one of these **conjunctive adverbs**, you can **take it out of the sentence completely** and the sentence will be structurally correct if it was structurally correct with the adverb, and it will wrong if it wrong with the adverb.

This means that this sentence is incorrect:

> 
> *I am hungry, however, I won't eat anything.*
>

    <summary>
        Can you think of why the above sentence is wrong? How might you fix them based on the rules we've covered so far?

    </summary>
        All four are [*run-on sentences*](#run-on-sentences) because the *conjunctive adverbs* don't connect sentences syntatically.
        > 
        > ❌*I am hungry, however, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        > ✅*I am hungry; however, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        > ✅*I am hungry. However, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        > ✅*I am hungry<span>&mdash;</span>however, I won't eat anything.*
        > 
        These are just a few of the possible ways we could fix this run-on sentence without changing the underlying structure too much.

Adverbs can be placed in many locations in a sentence.
> I like cats. However, I don't own one.
>
> I like cats. I, however, don't own one.
>
> I like cats. I don't, however, own one.
>
> I like cats. I don't own one, however.


Adverbs can be placed in many locations in a sentence.
> I like cats. However, I don't own one. I don't have time to take care of one.
>

>
> I like cats. I don't, however, own one. I don't have time to take care of one.
>
> I like cats. I don't own one, however. I don't have time to take care of one.

⛔ Conjunctive adverbs are **not conjunctions** so they can’t join sentences by themselves. They can be used with semicolons, colons, or dashes, however. Here are some examples:

> ❌ *I like cats, however, I don’t own one.*
> 
> ✅ *I like cats; however, I don’t own one.*
> 
> ❌ *I like dogs, for instance, I love Westies.*
> 
> ✅ *I like dogs: for instance, I love Westies.*
